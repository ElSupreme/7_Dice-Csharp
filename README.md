# 7_Dice-Csharp
7 Dice game but written in C#

Single game.cs file has multiple methods.

It will roll random dice (can change count and side variables in code).
It will create a game board.

The game board can be printed, solved, and checked.

Everything is in the console currently. Cleaning up the outputs, adding user selection, and creating a UI are next steps.
The solver is only very loosly optimized. It requires some thought to clean up and speed up. But for 5 dice games (original) it solves in about a second for now on my ageing laptop.

See this thread for what I created.
